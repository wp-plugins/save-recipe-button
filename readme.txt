Add a "Save Recipe" button to recipes on your Ziplist-powered food blog.

== Description ==

Many food bloggers have used Ziplist in the past to deliver "recipe box" and "grocery list" features to their site. In December 2014, Ziplist announced the closure of that feature.

This plugin adds it back, using the popular BigOven recipe and grocery list platform. BigOven is a leading recipe app with over 11 million downloads. It's free to use. This plugin
simply adds the "Save Recipe" button back to your Ziplist-powered blog, letting your readers save recipes for later (preserving a link to your original recipe).  They can also 
add recipes to a grocery list and carry it with them. It's free and easy to test out.  

In 2015 and beyond, BigOven will be highlighting recipes found by readers from around the web, and featuring those recipes in the apps with direct links. By adding the "Save Recipe"
feature to your blog, you're eligible for free, branded exposure to millions of additional home cooks.

This plugin:

* Adds a "Save Recipe" button to your Ziplist-formatted recipes. 

* Relies upon BigOven services, which are free. Your readers can save recipes, make a grocery list, resize recipes up or down and much more.  Users must create a free account with BigOven to save recipes or add items to their grocery list.

* **Add to Grocery List**: Your readers can save your recipes and/or add the ingredients to their grocery list with a single click. Your readers can download the free BigOven app and carry your recipes and ideas with them. Links to your original recipes are always provided, giving you full credit for your original content.

This plugin is designed specifically as an add-on to Ziplist.  Not using Ziplist?  No problem, we have great other options!  Please see the other ways to get the "Save Recipe" button
on your blog here:  http://wordpress.bigoven.com

== Installation ==

This plugin assumes you've got the Ziplist plugin installed and are using it to render your recipes. Simply install the BigOven Save Recipe plugin and activate it. That's it! You'll see 
a "Save" button right next to the "Print" button in each of your recipes.  Clicking this "Save" button will launch the recipe clipper.  (Known issue:  If you happen to have more than one 
Ziplist-formatted recipe on a given URL, in this release, the clipper will only grab the first one.  In a future update, it'll support multiple Ziplist-formatted recipes per page.)

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this do recipe markup? =

No, it relies upon the Ziplist plugin for this. We have a more full-featured option that does.  Please see http://wordpress.bigoven.com.

= Does this let me manage my recipes? =

No.  We have a more full-featured option that does.  Please see http://wordpress.bigoven.com.

= What formats does this support? = 

At present, this is meant to be a transition plugin for Ziplist-using food bloggers.  It simply adds back the "Save Recipe" and Mobile Grocery List features to your blog that Ziplist discontinued in December 2014, using BigOven as the new (free) recipe organizing platform.

= Does any of my data get sent to BigOven? =

Your recipes are your own.  When cooks decide to save a recipe, BigOven does store pointer snapshot information of your recipe privately,
complete with a link back to your recipe.  Your recipes are, and will always be, your own.  Be sure to read [BigOven's Pledge to Food Bloggers](http://wordpress.bigoven.com).

== Screenshots ==

1. When readers want to save your recipe, they simply click the Save button.
2. In this release, we're supporting Ziplist-formatted websites. So, if you've decided to keep the legacy Ziplist plugin, this will re-enable "save recipe" and "make grocery list" features for your readers.
3. Clicking the Save button launches a recipe clipper, letting your readers take your recipes (along with a link back) with them to the grocery store
