Add a "Save Recipe" button to recipes on your Ziplist-powered food blog, letting your readers easily make grocery lists and personal recipe boxes with BigOven.

== Description ==

Add a "Save Recipe" button and grocery list features to your food blog. This plugin is specially-designed for bloggers who have chosen to continue to use the Ziplist plugin, yet still want the benefits of "Save Recipe" and mobile grocery-list features. It adds back "save recipe" features using BigOven's popular recipe service instead.  (Ziplist announced the closure of their recipe box services on December 10, 2014.)  Features include:

* Add a "Save Recipe" button to your recipes. 

* Relies upon BigOven services, which are free. Your readers can save recipes, make a grocery list, resize recipes up or down and much more.  Users must create a free account with BigOven to save recipes or add items to their grocery list.

* **Add to Grocery List**: Your readers can save your recipes and/or add the ingredients to their grocery list with a single click. Your readers can download the free BigOven app and carry your recipes and ideas with them. Links to your original recipes are always provided, giving you full credit for your original content.

== Installation ==

The first version of this plugin is for those food bloggers who are keeping the Ziplist plugin live on their site, but want to add back the "Save Recipe" and mobile grocery list features back as easily as possible.  

This plugin doesn't change your data in any way, and no import or modification is done.  Prior and future posts will be updated with the new Save Recipe button, that's it!  It couldn't be easier, and it's free.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this do recipe markup? =

No. We have more full-featured options that do.  Please see http://wordpress.bigoven.com.

= What formats does this support? = 

At present, this is meant to be a transition plugin for Ziplist-using food bloggers.  It simply adds back the "Save Recipe" and Mobile Grocery List features to your blog that Ziplist discontinued in December 2014, using BigOven as the new (free) recipe organizing platform.

= Does any of my data get sent to BigOven? =

Your recipes are your own.  When cooks decide to save a recipe, BigOven does store pointer snapshot information of your recipe privately,
complete with a link back to your recipe.  Your recipes are, and will always be, your own.  Be sure to read [BigOven's Pledge to Food Bloggers](http://wordpress.bigoven.com).

== Screenshots ==

1. When readers want to save your recipe, they simply click the Save button.
2. In this release, we're supporting Ziplist-formatted websites. So, if you've decided to keep the legacy Ziplist plugin, this will re-enable "save recipe" and "make grocery list" features for your readers.
3. Clicking the Save button launches a recipe clipper, letting your readers take your recipes (along with a link back) with them to the grocery store
